## Homework 2 - HTML and CSS Practice

This project is a simple web page consisting of a landing page that showcases a product or service and an additional contact form page. The project demonstrates the use of modern HTML and CSS techniques, including Grid and Flexbox, to create a clean and visually appealing design.
